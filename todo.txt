1) Fix parametric surface normals.
2) Fix normals for rescaled objects
3) Fix true normals(these used to work???)

4)There is no advantage to keeping point and environment light seperate. Fix this.
5)Improve performance

idea: hyperboloids

!NOTE: If seams appear you are probably sending vec3 values 4 at a time.

!Conflict between different objects returning vertices/normals in different formats. Either the arrays should be already spread or in vec form.




Textures
1)Make sure scene waits for the texture to be loaded before rendering it.
2)Add the option to change filters(linear filter doesn't work well with pixel art)
3)Fix the horrendous uv computations
4)Minor bug: TexturedCube is rarely colored in green(default material color) in subsequent renders

Camera
1)Quaternions?

Optimization
1)Replace every vertex using vec4 with vec3
