1) Fix parametric surface normals.
2) Fix lighting for rescaled objects
3) Fix true normals(these used to work???)

4)There is no advantage to keeping point and environment light seperate. Fix this.
5)Improve performance

idea: hyperboloids

!NOTE: If seams appear you are probably sending vec3 values 4 at a time.

!Conflict between different objects returning vertices/normals in different formats. Either the arrays should be already spread or in vec form.
