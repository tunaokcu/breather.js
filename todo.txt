!To implement shading and rendering we need to calculate the surface normals

1)Better camera rotation(I have no idea what's going on right now, also "x" and "y" are mislabeled) -> 5 points
2)Possibly better optimization for generating objects

4)Gourard Shading -> 10 points
5)Phong shading -> 10 points

6)One rendering technique(bump/environment/parametric texture mapping) -> 20 points
