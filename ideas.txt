Some ideas for minor improvements:
    Sağ, sol alt, alt, sağ alt, sağ
    Ensure only one scene exists at a time(singleton class) -> unless we have multiple canvases each corresponding to a scene
    We could perhaps start without a canvas and allow the scene class to attach a canvas to the screen(together with the necessary UI?) on initialization and detach on deletion, thus ensuring there exists one canvas corresponding to one scene
    We could perhaps also allow dynamically loading shaders depending on certain conditions?..

Mid-size:
    Point light source class

Major features:
    A model loader class that can load any arbitrary model  
    Support for scene graphs
